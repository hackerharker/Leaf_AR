# Leaf_AR

This discursive tool engages people in a technologically mediated experience with nature as climate change fundamentally alters our experience of it. Climate change, in conjunction with our historical suppression of forest fires, has caused these now regular catastrophic seasonal events. It is a self perpetuating cycle as the carbon sequestering and climate change mitigating power of forests is negated as their biomass burns. The tool enables the user to ‘identify’ burnt tree leaves falling from trees in burning forests. However, more importantly, it is intended to increase awareness of relationality between ourselves and nature, with the belief that such engagement is the first step in positive futuring.

Using [AR on your phone](https://www.alexandraharker.com/Leaf_AR), you can view burnt leaves, which are brown, warped, broken, and sometimes bubbling, falling down around you. Tap on a leaf to identify the species. The leaf images used are ones posted on social media, by people either asking for help with identification or just reaching out to others sharing their disbelief of how far some of these leaves have traveled. Many of these leaves have drifted in with ash from trees burning miles away. In that regard, the project also shows how physical distance and sense of place becomes truncated in our shared experiences of poor air quality and falling ash. You can [explore the map](https://www.alexandraharker.com/Leaf_AR/map) to see spatial data about fire perimeters retrieved from [open-source government data](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/f72ebe741e3b4f0db376b4e765728339_0), and locations where the leaf specimens were found.

Eventually, the AR tool can evolve to use the user’s geolocation, real-time spatial data about fires, and machine learning to provide specific leaf identification suggestions. For example, identification suggestions can take into account specific characteristics of different leaf species when burnt, wind directions, locations of fires, user proximity to fires, and data on tree species in wildfire locations.
